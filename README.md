# Hey There :wave:

In this project, we are building a Weather App that will use React, Redux and make a call to OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather, so you always know if you are going to need an umbrella!

To start, clone the repository, npm install. You will need to create a .env file to store your api key from OpenWeatherMap API once you obtain one. Once setup, run npm run dev to start the program.

Enjoy :thumbsup:
